# ToDocial

## Manage your todos and share with friends
The projects is inspired by Github. A social media to create, track todos and share them publicly with friends and others. ToDocial is inspired by Github as a tool to let others cooperate on your todos and ideas. Just signup and create your first todo ‚ò∫Ô∏è


### Inspirations
This project is a combination of the features in Github and Wordpress that I could merge into one single project.
- Todo management & sociality (Github)
- Content management (Wordpress)


### Features
- Login / Sign up (multi-user)
- Todo Management
- User Profile
- Charts & Statistics
- Administrator Dashboard
- Simulation
- CI
- Tests
	- JUnit (REST API)
	- Selenium (Web pages)


## REST API
The path `/api/v1/*` is secured by Basic Authentication, so that, if the user is `enabled` and credentials are fine, he will receive his own resources.
