# ToDocial: Manage your todos and share with friends
A ToDo manager with Spring Boot. I am trying to make it as much as possible complete, as an industry product, at the same time, a project to learn stuff.

### Inspirations:

This project is a combination of the features in Github and Wordpress that I could merge into one single project.
- Todo management & sociality (Github)
- Content management (Wordpress)


### Features:

- Login / Sign up (multi-user)
- Todo Management
- User Profile
- Charts & Statistics
- Administrator Dashboard


### WIP:

- [x] Initialize Spring project

			- roles_privileges (many-to-many)
			- Privilege (low-level permissions)
		- verification_token
		- persistent_logins
		- password_reset_token
		- security_question
		- security_question_definition
		- users_follows(`follower` is following the `followed` user)
	- Todo
		- todo-log
		- todos_logs
	- [ ] Set username & password
	- [ ] Migrate to MySQL
- [ ] General
	- [x] Header/Navigation/Footer fragments
		- Spring Security JSP Taglib is added for easier control of authenticated users
	- [x] Set page title
		- Each page&#39;s title is encapsulated in `model`
	- [x] Support UTF-8 encoding
	- [x] Handle exceptions with exact error reason
		- All exceptions will be redirected to `/error` showing the reason and what happened.
		- [x] If any error occurs in subdirectories, the page is not shown correctly

	- [x] Modify
	- [x] Complete & Archive

	- [x] Log
		- During working on the todo, user might need to comment some thoughts
		- Not editable, only removable
	- [ ] mini-Task
	- [x] Progress bar
- [ ] Wishes
	- Todos that will be taken care later, at unknown time. When the user wants, he can turn a `wish` into a todo.
	- Other users can comment on his wishes, or help with appropriate advices.
- [ ] Log in
	- Spring Security 
	- There are two roles `ROLE_USER` and `ROLE_ADMIN`
	- Everyone can access `Log in` or `Sign up`, but for accessing the todos, the user must log in or sign up first.
	- User can not login on multiple clients at the same time
	- [x] After login, user shouldn't be able to login again
