# 3.3. Login Attempt with Missing Email/Password

## Objective
Verify that the system handles a login attempt appropriately when the email or password (or both) are missing.

## Preconditions
1. The user account is registered.
2. The login page is accessible.

## Test Steps
| # | When | Given | Then | Test Data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Navigate to login page <br> http://localhost:8080/login | | Login form is showed | |
| 2 |  | Leave the email or password (or both) fields empty | | username: `admin` <br> password: `12345` |
| 3 | Click on the "Login" button |  | The error message is shown | |


## Expected Results
- The system should display an error message indicating that the email and/or password fields are required.
- The user should not be granted access to the application.
- The login page should remain open for further attempts.

## Postconditions
- The user account should remain in the same state as before the login attempt.
- No changes should occur in the user's account status or information.

## Notes
- Verify that the error message clearly communicates that both email and password fields are mandatory.
- Ensure that the system provides appropriate validation messages for each missing field.
- Confirm that the system does not proceed with authentication if either the email or password is missing.
