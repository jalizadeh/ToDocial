## Expected Results
- The system should display an error message indicating the invalid credentials.
- The user should not be granted access to the application.
- The login page should remain open for further attempts.

## Postconditions
- The user account should remain in the same state as before the login attempt.
- No changes should occur in the user's account status or information.

## Notes
- Verify that the error message provides clear guidance on the nature of the error (e.g., "Invalid email address" or "Incorrect password").
- Ensure that the system does not reveal whether the email or password was incorrect to enhance security.
- Confirm that multiple consecutive failed login attempts do not lock the user out of the account (unless such a security measure is intentionally implemented).
