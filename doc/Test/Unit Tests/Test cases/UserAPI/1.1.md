# 1.1. Retrieve Current User Information

## Objective:
Verify that the system can successfully retrieve current user information when accessing the `/api/v1/user/me` endpoint.

## Preconditions:
1. The user is authenticated and has an active session.
2. The `/api/v1/user/me` endpoint is accessible.

## Test Steps:
| # | When | Given | Then | Test Data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Access the `/api/v1/user/me` endpoint | System returns current user's information | Verify the response returned by the system | Existing user |

## Expected Results:
- The system should return the current user's information.
- The response should include the user's details such as username, email, first name, last name, etc.
- The response status code should indicate success (e.g., HTTP status code 200).

## Postconditions:
- The user's session remains active.
- The user's information is accurately represented in the response.

## Test Data:
- Authentication token for a valid user session.

## Notes:
- Verify the correctness of the returned user information.
- Check for any additional metadata or headers included in the response.
- If the user session is expired or invalid, ensure that the system returns an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP status code 401).

## Risks and Considerations:
- Ensure that sensitive user information is not exposed in the response.
- Validate the behavior when the user session is invalid or expired.
- Verify that only the current user's information is returned and not that of other users.
