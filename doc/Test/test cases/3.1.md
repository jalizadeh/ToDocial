# High-Level Test Case: 3.1. User Login with Valid Credentials

## Objective
Verify that a user can successfully log in with a valid email and password.

## Preconditions
1. The user account is registered and active.
2. The login page is accessible.

## Test Steps
1. Open the login page on the application.
2. Enter a valid email address and password associated with a registered user account.
3. Click on the "Login" button.

## Expected Results
- The system should authenticate the user and grant access to the application.
- The user should be redirected to the application's main dashboard or home page.
- A successful login message or indicator should be displayed.

## Postconditions
- The user should have access to their account features.
- Verify the accuracy of the user's displayed information (e.g., username, profile picture).

## Notes
- Confirm that the login process is secure, and the entered password is masked.
- Check for any additional security measures (e.g., two-factor authentication).
- If applicable, test the "Remember Me" functionality.
- Verify the behavior in case of incorrect email or password entries (negative testing).
